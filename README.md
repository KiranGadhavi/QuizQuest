# Quiz Game Website

This is a fully functional quiz game website that I developed as part of my Week 3 project in the School of Code. The project demonstrates my knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to integrate a public quiz API to create an engaging and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Quiz Questions**: Fetches questions from a public quiz API.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score.
- **Progress **: Shows the player's progress through the quiz.
- **Lives**: The player has a limited number of lives.
- **Timer**: Each question is timed.
- **Try Again Button**: Allows the player to restart the quiz.

## What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to:
- Structure HTML for dynamic content.
- Style a web application using CSS for a better user experience.
- Use JavaScript to manage game logic, including score, progress, lives, and timer.
- Integrate a public API to fetch and display quiz questions.
- Handle user interactions and provide feedback.
